<p class="sp2"><span class="sc">The</span> Editor owes it to the reader to say that, in preparing the
following poem for re-publication, he has ventured to omit
some of the stanzas and to make changes in others. The stanzas
were omitted because, in his opinion, they broke the continuity
or retarded the flow of the narration, slackening the reader’s
interest, and could be omitted with advantage to the poem.
The changes have been mostly slight and formal, and, when
more extensive, have been made to modify (not the meaning,
but) only the expression; making it clearer or more direct, or
giving it an easier metrical movement.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="sc">What</span> time, dear Elton, we were wont to rove</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From classic Brown along fair Seekonk’s vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, in the murmurs of his storied cove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hear barbarous voices still our Founder hail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en then my bosom with young rapture hove</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To give to deathless verse the exile’s tale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every ripple’s moan or breeze’s sigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought back whole centuries as it murmured by.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon the transient dream of youth was gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And different labors to our lots were given;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You at the shrine of peace and glory shone,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sublime your toils, for still your theme was Heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, upon life’s tempestuous billows thrown,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A little bark before the tempest driven,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strove for a time the surging tide to breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And up its rolling mountains sought for rest.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wearied at length with the unceasing strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I gave my pinnace to the harbor’s lee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And left that ocean, still with tempests rife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To mad ambition’s heartless rivalry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No longer venturing for exalted life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(For storms and quicksands have no charms for me,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, in the listless labors of the swain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Provoke no turmoil and awake no pain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To drive the team afield and guide the plough,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or lead the herds to graze the dewy mead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wakes not the glance of lynx-eyed rival now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And makes no heart with disappointment bleed;</div>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[p. viii]</span><div class="verse indent0">Once more I joy to see the rivers flow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The lambkins sport, and brindled oxen feed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er the tranquil soul returns the dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which once she cherished by fair Seekonk’s stream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And when stern winter breathes the chilling storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And night comes down on earth in mantle hoar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I guide the herds and flocks to shelter warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And sate their hunger from the gathered store;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then round the cottage hearth the circle form</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of childhood lovelier than the vernal flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Partake its harmless glee and prattle gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And soothe my soul to tune the artless lay.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus were the numbers taught at first to flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Scarce conscious that they bore a tale along;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath my hand still would the pages grow,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They were not labor, but the joy of song;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still every line would unsung beauties show</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In Williams’ soul, and still the strain prolong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, all in rapture with the theme sublime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My thoughts spontaneous sought the embodying rhyme.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No man was he of heart with love confined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With blessings only for his bosom friend,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His glowing soul embraced the human kind,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He toiled and suffered for earth’s farthest end.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Touched by the truths of his unyielding mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The human soul did her long bondage rend;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stern Persecution paused—blushed—dropped the rod:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He strove like man, but conquered like a God.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now, my Elton, as in hours of ease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With aimless joy I filled this frail balloon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So like blind impulse bids me trust the breeze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And soar on dancing winds to fate unknown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And be my lot whatever chance decrees—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let gales propitious gently waft me on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or tempests dash far down oblivious night,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whate’er the goal, I tempt the heedless flight.</div>

<p>“<span class="sc">Roger Williams</span> was born of reputable parents in Wales,
A. D. 1598. He was educated at the University of Oxford; was
regularly admitted to Orders in the Church of England, and
preached for some time as a minister of that Church; but on
embracing the doctrines of the Puritans, he rendered himself
obnoxious to the laws against the non-conformists, and embarked
for America, where he arrived with his wife, whose name
was Mary, on the 5th of February, A. D. 1631.” He had
scarcely landed ere he began to assert the principle of religious
freedom, and insist on a rigid separation from the Church of
England. A declaration that the magistrate ought not to interfere
in matters of conscience could not fail to excite the jealousy
of a government constituted as that of Massachusetts
then was; and this jealousy was roused into active hostility
when, in the April following his arrival, he was called by
the Church of Salem as teaching Elder under their then
Pastor, Mr. Skelton.</p>

<p>“Of this appointment,” says Winthrop, “the Governor of
Massachusetts was informed, who immediately convened a
Court in Boston to take the subject into consideration.” Their
deliberations resulted in a letter addressed to Mr. Endicot, of
Salem, to this effect:—“That whereas Mr. Williams had refused
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[p. 178]</span>to join the churches at Boston, because they would not
make a public declaration of their repentance, for having communion
with the Churches of England while they tarried there,
and besides had declared his opinion that the magistrate might
not punish the breach of the Sabbath, nor any other offence that
was a breach of the first table; and therefore they marveled
they would choose him without advising with the council, and
withal desired him that they would forbear to proceed until they
had considered about it.”</p>

<p>This interference of the government forced him to leave
Salem. “He removed to Plymouth, and was engaged assistant
to Mr. Ralph Smith, the pastor of the church at that place.
Here he remained until he found his views of Religious Toleration
and strict non-conformity gave offence to some of his
hearers, when he returned again to Salem, and was settled there
after Mr. Skelton’s death, which took place on the 2d of August,
1634.” In this situation Williams preached against the cross in
the ensign, as a relic of papal superstition. His preaching however,
on this topic, does not seem to have been a subject of
complaint, only as it led some of his friends to the indiscretion
of defacing the colors. His persecutors, in excusing this act to
the government of England, say that they did so, “with as
much wariness as they might, being doubtful themselves of the
lawfulness of a cross in an ensign.” But though he may
have given no offence by declaring an opinion on this subject
so little at variance with their own, yet when he ventured to
speak against the king’s patent, by which he had granted to his
subjects the lands which belonged to the Indians; and, above
all, to maintain that the civil magistrate ought not to interfere
in matters of conscience, except for the preservation of peace, his
presence within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts could no
longer be tolerated. A summons was granted for his appearance
at the next court.</p>

<p>He appeared accordingly. “It was laid to his charge,” says
Winthrop, “that, being under question before the magistracy
and churches for divers dangerous opinions, viz: That the
magistrate ought not to punish for the breaches of the first table,
otherwise than in such cases as do disturb the public peace. 2d.
That he ought not to tender an oath to an unregenerate man.
3d. That a man ought not to pray with such, though wife,
children, &amp;c. 4th. That a man ought not to give thanks after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[p. 179]</span>
sacrament nor after meat, &amp;c., and that other churches were
about to write the church of Salem to admonish him of these
errors, notwithstanding the church had since called him to the
office of Teacher.”</p>

<p>These charges having been read, all the magistrates and ministers
concurred in denouncing the opinions of Williams as
erroneous and dangerous, and agreed that the calling him to
office at that time was a great contempt of authority. He and
the church of Salem were allowed until the next General Court
to consider of these charges, and then either to give satisfaction
to the Court, or else to expect sentence.</p>

<p>Much warmth of feeling was exhibited in the discussion of
these charges; and in the course of the debate it seems the ministers
were required to give their opinions severally. All agreed
that he who asserted that the civil magistrate ought not to interfere
in case of heresy, apostacy, etc., ought to be removed,
and that other churches ought to request the magistrates to
remove him. Nothing will give a better idea of the state of
feeling on this occasion than the fact that when the town of
Salem at this time petitioned, claiming some land at Marblehead
as belonging to the town, the petition was refused a hearing,
on the ground that the church of Salem had chosen Mr.
Williams her teacher, and by such choice had offered contempt
to the magistrates.</p>

<p>The attendance of all the Ministers of the Bay at the next
General Court was requested. This was held in the month of
November, 1635. Before this venerable congregation of all the
dignitaries of the church, Williams appeared, and defended his
opinions. His defence, it seems, was not satisfactory. They
offered him further time for conference or disputation. This
he declined, and chose to dispute presently. Mr. Hooker was
appointed to dispute with him. But Mr. Hooker’s logic, seconded
as it was by the whole civil and ecclesiastical power of
Massachusetts, could not force him to recognise the right of the
civil magistrate to punish heresy, or to admit that the king’s
patent could of itself give a just title to the lands of the Indians.
The consequence was, that on the following morning he was
sentenced to depart, within six weeks, out of the jurisdiction of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Such were the causes of Williams’ banishment, and such the
circumstances under which the decree was passed. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[p. 180]</span>
man who fearlessly asserted his principles, and practiced upon
them to their fullest extent. Persecution could not drive him
to a renunciation of his opinions. His observance of any
principle which he adopted was conscientiously strict; but this
very strictness of observance had its advantages, in enabling
him with more certainty to detect any latent error which his
opinions involved. He was as free to declare his errors as he
was to assert whatever appeared to him to be right. His very
honesty in this respect has given occasion to his enemies to
brand his character with inconsistency and apostacy; but he
remained true to every principle espoused by him, which posterity
has since sanctioned, and inconstant in those things only
which are unimportant in themselves, and which are unsettled
even in the present day. A tacit confession of his own fallibility
was implied in the great principle of which he was the
earliest asserter, that government ought not to interfere in matters
of conscience; and therein consisted a wide difference between
his errors, whatever they were, and those of his persecutors.
This fact, in estimating the character of Williams,
cannot be too well considered.</p>

<p>“Subsequently to his banishment, he was permitted to remain
until spring, on condition that he did not attempt to draw
others to his opinions.” But the friends of Williams could not
consent to see their favorite pastor leave them, without frequently
visiting him whilst they yet had an opportunity. In
these interviews, the plan of establishing a colony in the Narraganset
country, where the principle of Religious Freedom
(the assertion of which had been the chief cause of his banishment)
should be carried into effect, was discussed and matured.
It is also highly probable that he did not fail to do what he
conceived to be the duty of a faithful pastor in other respects.
At length the rumor of these meetings reached the ears of the
civil authorities; and in January, 1635, (O. S.,) “The governor
and assistants,” says Winthrop, “met in Boston to consider
about Mr. Williams; for they were credibly informed, that
he, notwithstanding the injunction laid upon him, (upon
liberty granted him to stay until spring,) not to go about to
draw others to his opinions, did use to entertain company in
his house, and to preach to them even of such points as he had
been sentenced for; and it was agreed to send him into England
by a ship then ready to depart. The reason was because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[p. 181]</span>
he had drawn about twenty persons to his opinions, and they
were intending to erect a plantation about the Narraganset bay,
from whence the infection would easily spread into these
churches, the people being many of them much taken with an
apprehension of his godliness. Whereupon a warrant was
sent to him to come presently to Boston, to be shipped,
&amp;c. He returned for answer, (and divers of Salem came with
it,) that he could not without hazard of his life, &amp;c. Whereupon
a pinnace was sent with commission to Captain Underhill,
&amp;c., to apprehend him, and carry him on board the ship,
which then rode at Nantascutt. But when they came to his
house they found he had been gone three days, but whither
they could not learn.”</p>

<p>It thus appears that the object of his government, in directing
his immediate apprehension at this time, was to prevent
the establishment of a colony in which the civil authority
should not be permitted to interfere with the religious opinions
of the citizens.</p>

<p>Williams was in the thirty-seventh or thirty-eighth year of his
age at the time of his banishment. He fled to a wilderness inhabited
only by savages. The two principal tribes—the Narragansets
and Wampanoags—had, but a short time before he entered
their country, been engaged in open hostilities. The government
of Plymouth had on one occasion extended its aid to
its early friend and ally, Massasoit, chief sachem of the Wampanoags.
This interference had smothered, but not extinguished
the flame. With these warring tribes, one of which
(the Narragansets) was a very martial and numerous people,
and exceedingly jealous of the whites, Williams was under the
necessity of establishing relations of amity. He himself says
that he was forced to travel between their sachems to satisfy
them and all their dependent spirits of his honest intentions to
live peaceably by them. He acted the part of a peace-maker
amongst them, and eventually won, even for the benefit of his
persecutors, the confidence of the Narragansets. It was
through his influence that all the Indians in the vicinity of Narraganset
bay were, shortly after his settlement at Mooshausick,
united, and their whole force, under the directions of the very
men who had driven him into the wilderness, brought to
co-operate with the Massachusetts forces against the Pequots.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[p. 182]</span>

<p>Manittoo—a God. It is a word which seems to have been applied
to an extraordinary power, or mysterious influence. Any
astonishing effect, produced by a cause which the Indians could
not comprehend, they appear to have ascribed to the agency of
a Manittoo. It is natural for man to draw his ideas of power or
causation, from what he feels in himself; and when he does so,
he will ascribe the effects which he observes to the influence of
mind. As he advances in knowledge the number of these mysterious
agents diminishes, until at last he is forced upon the
idea of one great, designing, first cause or agent. Man, from
his very constitution, therefore, must be a believer in the existence
of God. He approaches a knowledge of his unity by degrees,
and improves in his religious opinions in the same manner
as he advances to the science of astronomy. How essential
then is that freedom of opinion which our Founder sought to
establish!</p>

<p>It was the belief of the Chippewas, a tribe supposed to have
descended from the same original stock (Lenni Lenape) with
the Narragansets, that, before the earth appeared, all was one
vast body of waters; that the Great Spirit, assuming the shape
of a mighty eagle, whose eyes were as fire, and the sound of
whose wings was as thunder, passed over the abyss, and that,
upon his touching the water, the earth rose from the deep. It
was a prevailing tradition among the Delawares and other
tribes, according to Heckewelder, that the earth was an island,
supported on the back of a huge tortoise, called in the text
Unamis. It is the object of the author to embrace in the text
a selection of their scattered traditions on the subject of creation,
and to give them something like the consistency of a system.
Waban, therefore, adopting their leading ideas, has
drawn out his description into the appropriate sequency of
events. Their Creator was a Manittoo, a mysteriously operating
power, and of the same nature as that principle of causation
which they felt in themselves, as constituting their own
being. The term <i>Cowwewonck</i>, in the Narraganset dialect, signified
the soul, and was derived from <i>Cowwene</i>, to sleep; because,
said they, it operates when the body sleeps. Hence in
the text, whilst the Great Spirit slept, he is represented as commencing
the work of creation—operating on the immense of
waters as a part of his own being, and imparting to it organic
existences, (as the soul from itself creates its own conceptions,)
thus giving a sort of dreamy existence to the earth and all living
things, ere He assumed the shape of the eagle, and at his fiat
imparted to them substantial form and vital energy. The idea,
that the earth was raised out of the Ocean, seems to have been
pretty general amongst the Aborigines.</p>

<p>The pestilence, to which Waban has reference, is that which
shortly preceded the arrival of the Plymouth planters. The
Wampanoags, before this calamity, were relatively a powerful
people. Patuxet, afterwards Plymouth, was then under the
government of their sachem, who, at times, made it his place
of residence. Indeed the whole country between Seekonk and
the ocean, eastward, seems to have been occupied by tribes
more or less subject to him. Those toward the Cape and
about Buzzard’s Bay were, however, rather his tributaries than
his subjects. The different clans or communities, in this extensive
territory, were under the government of many petty
sachems, who regarded Ousamequin (afterwards Massasoit) as
their chief. Availing themselves of the misfortune of their
neighbors, the Narragansets extended their conquests eastward
over some of these under-sachems; and when Ousamequin fled
from Pawtuxet to Pokanoket, to avoid the devouring sickness,
he found not only Aquidnay, but a part of Pokanoket, subject to
his enemies. (See <a href="#Endnote_4.33">note to stanza <abbr title="33">xxxiii</abbr> canto <abbr title="4">iv</abbr></a>.) Pokanoket
was the Indian name of the neck of land between Taunton river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[p. 187]</span>
on the east, and Seekonk and Providence rivers on the west.
Mount Hope, or Haup as it is called in the text, forms its southeastern
extreme. The number of warriors stated in the text as
subject to Ousamequin, is hypothetical. Some of the Nipnets
were tributary to the Narragansets, but the greater part of
them were the allies or subjects of the Wampanoag Chief.</p>

<p>In compliance with the common orthography, the name of
this tribe is written <i>Maqua</i>. Williams says, that in the Narraganset

from mobo, to eat; and were considered Cannibals. It is probable,
from its location, that he speaks of the same tribe under
the name of Mitucknechakick, or tree eaters, “a people,” says
he, “so called, living between three and four hundred miles
west into the land, from their eating Mituckquash—that is,
trees. They are men-eaters—they set no corn, but live on the
bark of the chestnut and other fine trees,” &amp;c. Again, he says,
“The Maquaogs, or men-eaters, that live two or three hundred
miles west,” &amp;c. Thus it is plain that the Maquas were considered,
by the Narragansets and their neighboring tribes,
Cannibals.</p>

receiving many who fled to them from the devouring sickness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[p. 189]</span>
or plague in other parts of the land, but they had enlarged their
territories, both on the eastern and western boundaries. Their
numbers must have diminished rapidly, as Hutchinson estimates
their warriors in 1675 at two thousand; this estimate,
however, might not embrace those tribes which were subject to,
or dependant on them, when Williams entered the country.
They seem to have been a people greatly in advance of their
neighbors. They excelled in the manufacture of Wampumpeag,
and supplied other nations with it—also with pendants,
bracelets, tobacco pipes of stone, and pots for cookery. After
the arrival of the whites, they traded with them for their goods,
and supplied other tribes with them at an advance.</p>

<p>Under the general name of Narraganset, was included Narraganset
proper and Coweset. Narraganset proper extended south
from what is now Warwick to the ocean; Coweset, from Narraganset
northerly to the Nipmuck country, which now forms
Oxford, Mass., and some other adjoining towns. The western
boundaries of Narraganset and Coweset cannot be definitely ascertained.
Gookins says, the Narraganset jurisdiction extended
thirty or forty miles from Seekonk river and Narraganset
bay, including the islands, southwesterly to a place called
Wekapage, four or five miles to the eastward of Pawcatuck
river—that it included part of Long Island, Block Island,
Coweset and Niantick, and received tribute from some of the
Nipmucks. After some research, I am induced to believe that
the Nianticks occupied the territory now called Westerly; if so,
then the jurisdiction of the Narragansets extended to the Pawcatuck,
and perhaps beyond it. The tribe next westward was
that which dwelt “in the twist of Pequot river,” now called
the Thames; and was under the control of the fierce and warlike
Uncas, a chief who had rebelled against Sassacus, the
Pequot sachem, and detached from its allegiance a considerable
portion of his nation, of which he had formed a distinct
tribe.</p>

that Williams made the selection during the winter, when vegetation
afforded no criterion of the soil, whilst its very nakedness
was in some respects a recommendation. It was an object
with the early settlers to establish themselves in the neighborhood
of some clearing, and particularly on meadows in the
vicinity of rivers. These yielded pasturage through the summer,
and forage for their cattle during winter, and land for
tillage without the preparatory steps of clearing.</p>

<p>Williams says that, at the time of his first entering the Narraganset
country, a great contest was raging between Canonicus
and Miantonomi on one side, and Massasoit or Ousamequin on
the other. Williams, at this time, had come to the resolution
of settling at Seekonk, on a part of the lands belonging to the
latter sachem. But should actual hostilities be commenced
between these tribes, his situation would become peculiarly
dangerous, occupying as he would, lands on the frontiers of the
weaker party. The Narragansets might regard his settlement
as a mere trading establishment, supplying their enemies with
arms. Besides, the Narragansets and Wampanoags, in many
instances, laid claim to the same lands. [See <a href="#Endnote_4.33">note to stanza
thirty-third, canto fourth</a>.] To obtain a peaceable possession
of these lands it was necessary to have the consent of both. A
reconciliation, therefore, of the contending tribes became indispensable.
Williams incidentally mentions that he travelled between
them to satisfy them of his intentions to live peaceably
by them, and it is hardly possible that the equally necessary
object of their reconciliation was neglected. Indeed, we find,
shortly after Williams entered their country, these chiefs, so
recently hostile, amicably granting their lands to him and his
associates, and one of them yielding to the authority of the
other. Hence we may infer that Williams not only attempted
to pacify them, but that his efforts were crowned with success.</p>

<p>Ousamequin, or Ashumequin, was the name of the Wampanoag
chief, until about the time of the Pequot war, when he
assumed the name of Massasoit, or Massasoyt, for it is variously
written. The latter is used in the text as that by which
he is most generally designated. It was common for the Indians
to change their names. That of Miantonomi was originally
Mecumeh.</p>

<p>To name the dead was considered a great indignity, and,
among chiefs, a sufficient cause for war. Philip pursued one
who had thus offended to Nantucket. The life of the offender
was saved only by the interference of the whites. To avoid uttering
the names of the dead they used circumlocutions, such as
<i>Sachem-aupan</i>, <i>Nes-mat-aupan</i>; the sachem that was here, our

Church called to his Indian, Peter, and asked who that

<p>Williams says the Indians were very shy and jealous of selling

a very dear bargain.</p>

<p>Of Peag there were two sorts—the white and black. The
former was called Wampom or Wampum, the latter Suckauhock.
The first was wrought from the white, the last from the

<p>The reader will not expect in the text minute historical accuracy,
yet it has been the wish of the author, throughout, not to
violate <span class="allsmcap">KNOWN</span> historical truth; and the following facts, he
thinks, give something more than mere probability to the presumption,
that Massasoit was, before the arrival of the whites,
in some sense, one of the subject sachems of the Narraganset
chiefs. The following extract of a deposition of Williams,
dated at Narraganset, the 18th of June, A. D. 1682, will shew
that Canonicus had authority of some sort over Massasoit, and
that the latter had claims, subordinate to those of Canonicus,
to certain lands which Williams procured of the last named
chief. In this deposition Williams says, “I desire posterity to
see the most gracious hand of the Most High, (in whose hands
are all things,) that when the hearts of my countrymen and
friends and brethren failed me, his infinite wisdom and merits
stirred up the barbarous heart of Canonicus to love me
as his own son to the last gasp, by which I had not only Miantonomi
and all the Coweset sachems my friends, but Ousamequin
also, who, because of my great friendship for him at Plymouth,
and the authority of Canonicus, consented freely,
(being also well gratified by me,) to the Governor Winthrop’s
and my enjoyment of Prudence, yea of Providence itself, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[p. 196]</span>
all other parts I procured which were upon the point, and in
effect, whatever I desired of him.” A distinction seems here to
be intended between Prudence and other places. It is probable
that Prudence was conquered by the Narragansets, whilst in
possession of some under-sachem of Massasoit. And when the
latter renounced all claims to this Island, he at the same time
assured to Williams the peaceable enjoyment of Providence and
all other places purchased of him.</p>

<p>A similar state of things appears in the deed, made by
Canonicus and Miantonomi to the settlers of Aquidnay, to have
existed both in reference to that island and a part of Pokanoket,
where Massasoit resided. This deed or memorandum is as
follows: “We, Canonicus and Miantonomi, the two chief
sachems of Narraganset, by virtue of our general command
of the Bay, as also the particular subjecting of the dead
sachem of Aquidnick and Kitackumuckqut, [Kikemuet] themselves
and lands unto us, have sold unto Mr. Coddington and
his friends united, the great Island of Acquidnick, lying from
hence eastward in this bay, as also the marsh or grass upon
Quinnannacut, [Conanicut] and the rest of the islands in the
bay, (excepting Chubackuweda, formerly sold unto Mr. Winthrope,
Governor of Massachusetts, and Mr. Williams of Providence,)
also the grass upon the rivers and coasts about Kitakamuckqut,
and from thence to Pauparquatsh [Poppasquash]
for the full payment of forty fathoms of white beads.”</p>

<p>Ousamaquin was present, and granted the use of the grass
and trees on the main land, Pocasset side. Tradition points
out the spot on which the battle was fought that decided the fate
of Aquidnick, and assigns a date to the arrival of the English at
Plymouth. Callender evidently considers it to have taken place
during the great sickness or plague which prevailed among the
eastern Indians before the coming of the Whites. When the
English arrived, Massasoit was at Pokanoket, in a part of that
territory so recently wrested by the Narragansets from (probably)
one of his under-sachems. He was then in no condition
to resist any of the demands of the victors, and there can be
little doubt that he submitted to them as a tributary or subject
chief. The arrival of the English, however, gave him allies,
and enabled him to set the Narragansets at defiance. Hence
the hostility of the Narragansets to the Whites; and hence Massasoit’s
uniform adherence to them. That Massasoit was considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[p. 197]</span>
by the Narragansets a tributary chief, and bound to
comply with the requisitions of their sachems, is rendered very
probable by the following passage in Winthrop’s Journal. It
is under date of April, 1632:</p>

<p>“The Governor received letters from Plymouth signifying
that there had been a broil between their men at Sowamset and
the Narraganset Indians, who set upon the English house,
there to have taken Ousamaquin, the Sagamore of Pokanoscott,
[Pokanoket] who fled thither with all the people for refuge, and
that Captain Standish, being gone thither to relieve the English
which were in the House, sent home in all haste for more
men and other provisions, upon intelligence that Canonicus
was coming with a great army against them. On that, they
wrote to our Governor for some powder to be sent with all possible
speed, for it seemed they were unprovided. Upon this
the Governor presently dispatched away a messenger with so
much powder as he could carry, viz: twenty-seven pounds.
The messenger returned and brought a letter from the Governor,
signifying that the Indians were retired from Sowamset to fight
the Pequins, [Pequots] which was probable; because John
Sagamore and Chickatabott were gone, with all their men, to
Canonicus, who had sent for them.”</p>

<p>Here Canonicus, on the point of marching against the Pequots,
sent to certain sachems of Massachusetts to join him;
there is little doubt that the same requisition was made of Massasoit,
and attempted to be enforced. He took shelter, however,
under the English, and the Narragansets finding that
they could not compel obedience without involving themselves
in a war with the English, retired and prosecuted the expedition
without his assistance. But in 1636, when they were somewhat
relieved from the pressure of their enemies, they were probably
about engaging in a war with the Wampanoags, to punish
this contempt of their chief’s authority. Hence the great contest
to which Williams alludes.</p>

<p>As a further proof that Massasoit was in some sort a subordinate
sachem of the Narraganset chiefs, it may be added, that
the above deed of Aquidnick appears to have been made in his
presence, and that he and his tribe were afterwards compensated
for their rights in the lands conveyed. Those rights were
therefore considered of a character subordinate to those of the
Narraganset chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[p. 198]</span>
Since the foregoing remarks were written, the author has
noticed a deposition of Williams, quoted by Backus, in his History
of the Baptists, and dated twenty-five years after the settlement
of Providence was commenced, which applies directly
to the question here discussed, and abundantly confirms the
views already taken. Williams, in his deposition, says, “After
I had obtained this place, now called Providence, of Canonicus
and Miantonomi, [the chief Nanhiganset sachems,] Osamaquin
laid his claim to this place also. This forced me to repair
to the Nanhiganset sachems aforesaid, who declared that Osamaquin
was their subject, and had solemnly, himself in person
with ten men, subjected himself and his lands unto them at the
Nanhiganset, only now he seemed to revolt from his loyalty,
under the shelter of the English at Plymouth. This I declared
from the Nanhiganset sachems to Osamaquin, who without
any stick acknowledged to be true that he had so subjected,
as the Nanhiganset sachems had affirmed; [but] that he was
not subdued by war, which himself and his father had maintained
against the Nanhigansets; but God, said he, subdued us
by a plague which swept away my people, and forced me to
yield.”</p>

<p>“Canonicus, the old high sachem of the Narraganset bay, (a

in a solemn assembly, using this word, [Wannaumwayean, if
he speak true,] said, I have never suffered any wrong to be offered
to the English since they landed, nor never will. He often
repeated this word, Wannaumwayean, Englishman, if the Englishman
speak true, if he meane truly; then shall I goe to my
grave in peace, and hope that the English and my posteritie
shall live in love and peace together. I replied that he had no
cause (as I hoped) to question the Englishman’s Wannaumauonck,
that is, faithfulnesse, he having had long experience of
their faithfulnesse and trustinesse. He took a stick and broke
it into ten pieces, and related ten instances, (laying down a
stick at every instance), which gave him cause thus to feare and
say. I satisfied him on some presently, and presented the rest
to the governors of the English, who I hope will be far from
giving just cause to have barbarians question their Wannaumwauonck
of faithfulnesse.”—<cite>Williams’ Key.</cite></p>

<p>“The people called Narragansets,” says the N. E. Memorial,
“sent messengers unto our plantations with a bundle of arrows
tied together with a snake-skin, which the interpreter told them
was a threatening and a challenge, upon which the Governor of
Plymouth sent them a rough answer, viz.: That, if they loved
war better than peace, they might begin when they would; they
had done them no wrong, neither did they fear them, nor should
they find them unprovided; and by another messenger they
sent the snake-skin back again, with bullets in it; but they
would not receive it, but sent it back again.” Mr. Davis in a
note adds: “The messenger was accompanied by a friendly
Indian, Tockamahamon. The messenger inquired for Squanto,
who was absent. The bundle of arrows was left for him, and
the messenger departed without any explanation. When
Squanto returned, and the dubious present was delivered him,
he immediately understood the object.” The planters, however,
seem to have considered themselves threatened. They immediately
began to strengthen their defences, and every precaution
was taken against a surprise.</p>

Miantonomi were the contrivers of Mr. Oldham’s death, and the

</div>

<p>Nothing is said of Williams, by the histories of the age, from
the time he left Salem, until his expulsion from Seekonk, afterwards
called Rehoboth. We learn, from some of Williams’
letters, that, after purchasing land from Massasoit, he there
built and planted, before he was informed by Governor Winslow
that he was within the limits of the Plymouth patent.
Until this information, he had supposed himself to be beyond
the limits of either Plymouth or Massachusetts. And, certainly,
the language of the Plymouth patent was sufficiently equivocal
to countenance almost any construction of it in reference to the
western (otherwise called southern) bounds of its grant. I will
transcribe its words, that the reader may judge for himself. It
grants the lands “lying between Cohasset rivulet toward the
north, and Narraganset river toward the south, the great Western
Ocean toward the east, and a straight line, extending into
the main land toward the west, from the mouth of Narraganset<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[p. 204]</span>
river to the utmost bounds of a country called Pokanoket, alias
Sowamset, and another straight line, extending directly from
the mouth of Cohasset river toward the west, so far into the
main land westward, as the utmost limits of Pokanoket, alias
Sowamset.”</p>

<p>What is here intended by Narraganset river? Is it the bay or
some river falling into the bay? Was it intended by the utmost
bounds of Pokanoket? Do the words of the patent include or
exclude that territory? The truth is, that the geography of the
country was, at that time, very imperfectly understood, and the
words of the patent are not a true description of the territory to
be granted. The charter of Rhode Island is a proof that the
Plymouth patent was not considered as embracing within its
limits what is called Pokanoket, alias Sowamset; since that
charter covers a considerable part of that very territory. But,
if Pokanoket was not included by the Plymouth patent, Williams
ought not to have been treated as a trespasser. It is not my
purpose to discuss the question of boundaries. These observations
are made for the purpose of showing that Williams had
his reasons for believing that he was out of the jurisdiction of
Plymouth.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the first intention of the author to have drawn the
materials of the conversation in the text from the controversy
between Williams and Cotton; but, on examination, he was
satisfied that it was not suited to a performance of this kind.
This controversy originated as follows: A prisoner (one who
was doubtless suffering for heretical opinions) addressed a
letter to a Mr. Hall, in which he discussed and argued against
the right of government to persecute for matters of conscience.
Hall sent this letter to Mr. Cotton, who answered it. Hall,
dissatisfied with the answer, transmitted it to Williams. In
the hands of Williams it remained some time; for he was
struggling with all the difficulties incident to his situation at
Providence. He however composed a reply to Cotton’s answer,
which he entitled the Bloody Tenent. He says it was
written whilst engaged at the hoe and oar, toiling for bread—whilst
attending on Parliament—in a change of rooms and
places; in a variety of strange houses; sometimes in the field,
in the midst of travel; where he had been forced to gather and
scatter his loose thoughts and papers. And, certainly, considering
the circumstances in which it was composed, it is a work
calculated to increase our admiration of the man. The Bloody
Tenent, together with Mr. Cotton’s answer to the prisoner’s
letter, was published in London, at a time when his Puritan
brethren in England were addressing him and others in Massachusetts,
with most earnest remonstrances against their cruel
persecutions of other denominations.</p>

<p>He, in his replies, had been endeavoring to extenuate and
excuse the conduct of the civil government, and had taken particular
care to exculpate himself. It is easy, therefore, to conceive
what a shock this reverend dignitary must have suffered,
when his answer to the prisoner’s letter, which went in principle
the full length of the most unsparing persecution, together
with Williams’ reply, was published and circulated among the
brethren there. He instantly raised a cry, that Williams was
<cite>persecuting him</cite>, by publishing his answer to the prisoner’s letter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[p. 207]</span>
and commenting upon it. But he felt himself under the
necessity of doing something more. His brethren in England
would require some sort of justification, and one consistent
with the sentiments he had already expressed in his letters to
them. Hence the controversy between him and Williams, is,
on the part of Cotton, a sophistical attempt to avoid the charge
of persecuting for matters of conscience. We do not persecute
consciences, says he, but we do punish those who commit violence
on their own consciences. If the reader should be so
curious as to inquire, how Mr. Cotton ascertained when a man
committed violence on his own conscience, I will state his process
as I understand it. When it was discovered that any member
entertained opinions inconsistent with the fundamental doctrines
of the order to which he belonged, he was in the first place
called before the church, and admonished of his error. If he
still persisted, he was summoned before the magistracy, where
the charges were specified, and the magistracy determined
whether he was or was not convinced in his own mind of his
errors. His judges never failed to be satisfied that he was convinced.
If the accused afterwards persisted in his opinions, he
was considered as one committing violence on his own conscience,
and treated as an incorrigible heretic and disturber of
the peace, and as such banished, imprisoned, scourged, or
hanged, as the enormity of his heretical opinions might require.
I have necessarily given the conversation between Williams
and the Plymouth elder a turn different from that of the
controversy between him and Cotton; but have endeavored to
preserve something of the tone of feeling which pervades the
latter. I flatter myself, however, that the Plymouth elder is a
more moderate man than Mr. Cotton. As a proof, hear Mr.
Cotton in his own words set forth the advantages which a state
derives from persecuting heretics, and the summary mode in
which the civil magistrate may deal with them.</p>

<p>To the question of Williams, What glory to God—what good
to the souls and bodies of their subjects, did these princes bring
in persecuting? Mr. Cotton thus replies: “The good that is
brought to princes and subjects, by the due punishment of
apostate seducers and idolaters and blasphemers, is manifold.</p>

<p>First; it putteth away evil from the people, and cutteth off a
gangrene which would spread to further ungodliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[p. 208]</span>Secondly; It driveth away wolves from worrying and scattering
the sheep of Christ; (for false teachers be wolves.)</p>

<p>Thirdly; Such executions upon such evil doers causeth all
the country to hear and fear, and do no more such wickedness.</p>

<p>Fourthly; The punishments, executed upon false prophets
and seducing teachers, do bring down showers of God’s blessings
upon the civil state.</p>

<p>Fifthly; It is an honor to God’s justice that such judgments
are executed.”</p>

<p>He says, “If there be stones in the streets the magistrate
need not fetch a sword from the smith’s shop, nor a halter from
the roper’s, to punish a heretic.”</p>

<p>It will appear that time has made no improvement upon the
leading principles of Williams, as gathered from different parts
of his replies to Cotton. He says that “the people are the
origin of all free power in government.” “That the people are
not invested by Christ Jesus with power to rule his Church.”
That they can give no such power to the magistrate. “That
the kingdom of Christ is spiritual”—that to introduce the civil
sword into this spiritual kingdom is “to confound Heaven
and earth together, and lay all upon heaps of confusion”—“Is
to take Christ and make him king by force (John vi, 15)—to
make his kingdom of this world—to set up a civil and temporal
Israel—to bound out new earthy lands of Canaan; yea,
and to set up a Spanish inquisition, in all parts of the world,
to the speedy destruction of millions of souls,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cotton says, “that when the kingdoms of this earth become
the kingdoms of the Lord, it is not by making Christ a temporal
king; but by making the temporal kingdoms nursing fathers to
the Church”—“that religion was not to be propagated by the
sword; but protected and preserved by it.”</p>

<p>Williams replies, “that the husbandman weeds his garden to
increase his grain, and that consequently it is the object of the
hand that destroys the heretic to make the Christian”—“That
the sword may make a nation of hypocrites, but not of Christians,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I have thrown together these few detached sentences, that the
reader, who may have little inclination to peruse a controversy
on a question which happily has no place in the present age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[p. 209]</span>
may form some opinion of its character. The discussion occupies
two considerable volumes.</p>

<p>Williams, in his letter to Mason, says, that Governor Winthrop
and some of the council of Massachusetts were disposed
to recall him from banishment, and confer upon him some
mark of distinguished favor for his services. “It is known,”
says Williams, “who hindered—who never promoted the liberty
of other men’s consciences.” Mr. Davis, in a note to his edition
of the New England Memorial, conjectures that he alludes
to Mr. Dudley. The reader will not consider me as doing violence
to historical probability, by supposing that this man gave
information to the magistrates of Plymouth that Williams had
established himself within the limits of their patent, and required<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[p. 210]</span>
his expulsion. He was the author of the following
lines:</p>

<p>The patents of the companies which settled in this country
granted them lands without any reference to the rights of the
natives. But the companies never availed themselves of these
grants to that extent. Whatever may have been their opinions,
they acted under them as if they had only invested them with
the right of pre-emption. Cotton Mather is the only historian,
that I recollect, who makes a merit of paying the Indians for
their lands, and of not expelling them immediately from the
soil in virtue of these patents.</p>

<p>I have represented Williams, throughout this narrative, as
unaccompanied by any of his Salem friends. And such, I think,
was the fact up to the time he left, or was about leaving, Seekonk.
Indeed, there was no necessity for any of his friends to
accompany him in his flight from Salem “in the winter’s snow.”
They could render him no assistance in negotiations with the
Indians.—They could not alleviate his hardships by participating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[p. 211]</span>
in them. But what seems to settle the question, (if in fact
it be a question) is, that he himself, though he frequently alludes
to his sufferings and transactions “during the bitter cold
winter,” no where intimates that any white man participated in
them. He uniformly speaks in the first person singular: “I
was sorely tossed for fourteen weeks—I left Salem in the winter’s
snow—I found a great contest going on between the
chiefs—I travelled between them—I first pitched and began to
build and plant at Seekonk—I received a message from Mr.
Winslow—I crossed the Seekonk and settled at Mooshausick.”
It is strange that he should, on no occasion, mention that some
of his friends suffered with him, if any actually did. All accurate
information concerning Williams, during these fourteen
weeks, must, I apprehend, be drawn from his writings; and I
have chosen to follow them. And indeed had he been accompanied
by one or more of his friends, they could not have aided
the author in the conduct of his narrative, any more than they
could have borne a part in the trials and labors of Williams.</p>

<p>Williams says that he mortgaged his house and land in Salem
to go through, and all that came with him afterwards were not
engaged, but came and went at pleasure; but he was forced to
go through and stay by it. (His purchase of the Indians.)</p>

<p>I have not been able to ascertain in what particular part of
Seekonk Williams attempted to form his plantation, and have
consequently felt myself at liberty to suppose it was in the
neighborhood of Pawtucket Falls.</p>

<p>Netop—friend. The tradition is, that when Williams in a
canoe approached the western banks of the river, at a place now
called Whatcheer Cove, he saw a gathering of the natives.
When he had come within hail, he was accosted by them in
broken English with the friendly salutation, “Wha-cheer! Wha-cheer!”
Here he landed, and was kindly received by them.
The land which was afterwards set off to him included this spot,
and he commemorated the amicable greeting of his Indian
friends by naming the field there assigned to him the Manor of
Whatcheer, or Whatcheer Manor. This field is now the property
of Governor Fenner, and the field adjoining it, which was likewise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[p. 212]</span>
set forth to Williams, has continued to the present day in
the possession of his descendants. We are probably indebted
to the name which Williams gave the first mentioned field, for
the preservation of this tradition.</p>

<p>To show that Williams was not without a presentiment of the
temporal advantages that might arise to his projected settlement,
from a full liberty in religious concernments, I quote the
following from his memorial to Parliament, prefixed to his
Bloody Tenent made more bloody, &amp;c. Speaking of Holland
he says: “From Enchuysen, therefore, a den of persecuting
lions and mountain leopards, the persecuted fled to Amsterdam,
a poor fishing town, yet harborous and favorable to the flying,
though dissenting consciences. This confluence of the persecuted,
by God’s most gracious coming with them, drew boats—drew
trade—drew shipping, and that so mightily in so short a
time, that shipping, trade, wealth, greatness, honor, (almost to
astonishment in the eyes of all Europe and the world), have appeared
to fall, as out of Heaven, in a crown or garland upon the
head of this poor fishertown.”</p>

<p>The first grant made by Canonicus and Miantonomi to Williams,
appears to have been a verbal grant of all the lands and
meadows upon the two fresh rivers, called Mooshausick and
Wanaskatucket; but on the 24th of March, 1637, they confirmed
this grant by deed, and, in consideration of the many kindnesses

the bounds Pawtuxet river on the south, Pawtucket on the

of the county of Kent.</p>

<p>This passage, it is true, supposes action on the mind by a
supernatural being, but it does not suppose the outward bodily
manifestation of the angelic form described. It simply supposes
the image or conception, wrought in the mind by the
supernatural agency, to <em>externize</em> itself through a change
effected by a sympathetic action in the visual organ. Or, in
other words, it supposes the internal image to become so distinct
as to reflect itself into the retina and overcome the action
of external objects thereon; whereby the internal image is made
to appear in the field of vision as an external reality. In justification
of this idea, I am glad to have it in my power to refer
to No. C. of the Family Library, entitled “Outlines of Disordered
Mental Action, by Professor Upham, of Bowdoin College”—p. 117.</p>

<p>I feel that these remarks are due to the very friendly criticism
which this poem has received on the other side of the Atlantic;
in which, understanding (as I suppose) the apparition to be
represented as an external reality, the reviewer blames it as an
extravagance not in accordance with the general character of
the narrative.</p>

<p>Williams carried the philanthropy, which breathes in his great
principle of Soul-Liberty, into all the important acts of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[p. 214]</span>
Although the munificent grant of Canonicus and Miantonomi
had been made to him only, he shortly after made it the common
property of his friends who joined him at Providence,
reserving to himself no more than an equal share, and receiving
from them the small sum of thirty pounds, not as purchase
money, but as a remuneration for the gratuities which he had
made to the Indians out of his own estate.</p>

<p>“The following passage,” says Mr. Benedict, in his history
of the Baptists, “explains, in a very pleasing manner, Mr. Williams’s
design in these transactions: ‘Notwithstanding I had
frequent promise from Miantonomi, my kind friend, that it
should not be land that I should want about these bounds
mentioned, provided I satisfied the Indians there inhabiting, I
having made covenant of peaceable neighborhood with all the
sachems and natives round about us, and having <cite>in a sense of
God’s merciful Providence to me in my distress, called the place
Providence; I desired it might be for a shelter to persons
distressed for conscience. I then considered the condition of
divers of my countrymen</cite>. I communicated my said purchase
unto my loving friends, John Throckmorton and others, who
then desired to take shelter here with me. And whereas, by
God’s merciful assistance, I was procurer of the purchase, not
by moneys nor payment, the natives being so shy and jealous
that moneys could not do it, but by that language—acquaintance
and favor with the natives, and other advantages which it
pleased God to give me, and also bore the charges and venture
of all the gratuities which I gave to the great sachems and
natives round about us, and lay engaged for a loving and peaceable
neighborhood with them to my great charge and travel; it
was therefore thought fit that I should receive some consideration
and gratuity.’ Thus, after mentioning the said thirty
pounds, ‘this sum I received, and in love to my friends and
<cite>with respect to a town and place of succor for the distressed as
aforesaid</cite>, I do acknowledge this said sum a full satisfaction,’ he
went on, in full and strong terms, to confirm those lands to
said inhabitants, reserving no more to himself that an equal
share with the rest; his wife also signing the deed.”</p>

APPENDIX.</h2></div>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p class="sp2"><span class="sc">Having</span> in the preceding notes given some account of the
principal events which marked the life of Williams up to the
time he settled at Mooshausick, it may be agreeable to such of
my readers, as have not his biography at hand, to find here
some notice of the actions which distinguished the remainder of
his days. The following summary is drawn chiefly from Mr.
Benedict’s History of the Baptists, and the Sketch of the Life of
Williams annexed to the first volume of the Rhode Island Historical
Collections.</p>

<p>Williams was soon joined at Providence by a number of his
friends from Salem. In a short time their number amounted to
forty persons. They then adopted a form of government, by
which they admitted none to become their associates, but such
as held to the principle of Religious Freedom.</p>

<p>The year following his settlement, a formidable conspiracy of
the Indians was planned against the English colonists. He
gave his persecutors information of the fact. He addressed a
letter to the Commissioners of the United Colonies, “assuring
them that the country would suddenly be all on fire, meaning
by war—that by strong reasons and arguments he could convince
any man thereof that was of another mind—that the Narragansets
had been with the plantations combined with Providence,
and had solemnly settled a neutrality with them, which
fully shewed their counsels and resolutions for war.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Had
this plot been carried into effect, it would probably have eventuated
in the ruin of the colonies from which he had been banished.
Instead of indulging resentment by remaining inactive,
he immediately exerted himself to bring about a dissolution of
the Indian confederacy. He accomplished what no other man
in New England at that time would have attempted. By his influence
with the Narragansets, he broke up the combination,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[p. 216]</span>and formed treaties between them and the United Colonies, by
which the latter had their aid in the war which followed with
the Pequots.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="spaced">
<a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> <cite>Hutchinson’s State Papers.</cite></p>
</div>

<p>The first four years that succeeded Williams’ settlement at
Providence, were necessarily occupied by him there about the
affairs of the plantations. He travelled amongst the Indians,
and secured the friendship of their chiefs and warriors. He
promoted the settlement of Rhode Island and Warwick. Much
of his time must also have been required in making provisions
for the support of his family, cast out, as they were, into the
depths of a savage wilderness. Soon after his settlement, he
had embraced the leading tenets of the Baptists, and had been
baptized. He then formed a society of this order, and preached
to it; but resigned his pastoral office on his going to England
to solicit the first Charter.</p>

<p>Not being permitted to pass through Massachusetts in order
to embark on this voyage, he went by land to Manhattan, [New
York,] then under the Dutch. A war between the Dutch and
Indians was at that time raging with great violence. In this
war, Mrs. Ann Hutchinson and family, who had been banished
from Massachusetts, had fallen victims to Indian barbarities;
and, as if every step of this remarkable man was to bear the
impress of his benevolence, he was here instrumental in pacifying
the savages, and stopping the effusion of blood. After this,
he took ship for England. Whilst on this voyage, that no time
might be lost in laying posterity under obligations to him, he
composed his Key to the Indian Languages. This, together
with his Bloody Tenent, was published on his arrival in England.
Here, as agent for the colonies of Providence, Rhode
Island, and Warwick, he obtained a charter of incorporation,
signed by the Earl of Warwick, then Governor and Admiral of
the English Plantations, and by his council.</p>

<p>On the 17th September, 1644, he landed at Boston, bringing
a letter of recommendation to the Governor and Assistants of
Massachusetts Bay, from some of the most influential members
of the Long Parliament. He thus avoided the penalty incurred
by entering their bounds. At the first General Assembly
formed under this Charter, a law was passed establishing the
most unlimited toleration in matters of conscience. Unconfined
to those who professed Christianity, its provisions extended
to the whole human family. I mention this, because it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[p. 217]</span>
has been said that Maryland furnishes the first example of a
legislative act of this kind. The Maryland act was passed in
1649, and its privileges extended only to those who professed to
believe in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Mr. Coddington afterwards procured a Charter, which gave
him almost unlimited authority over the islands of Narraganset
bay. This caused great discontent. It was called <i>Coddington’s
Obstruction</i>. Williams and Clark were sent to England,
in 1651, to procure its revocation. They effected the
object of their mission in October, 1652. Whilst in England,
Williams resided with Sir Henry Vane, at his seat in Lincolnshire.
He returned in 1652, and brought a letter from Sir
Henry, inviting the planters to a close union. The colony,
during his absence, had been distracted by many divisions.
This letter, together with the earnest solicitations of Williams,
restored harmony. He was several times after, as well as before
this, elected to the office of President or Governor of the
colony.</p>

<p>Williams died in 1683, at Providence, and was buried under
arms, in his family burying ground, with every testimony of
respect which the colony could manifest.</p>

<p>The religious sentiments of Williams seem to have become
more and more liberal as he advanced in life. Whatever rigid
forms those sentiments may have assumed, in the early part of
his career, they gradually melted down, and blended themselves
in that warm and deep feeling of universal benevolence, which
had given birth to his great principle of Soul-Liberty. The
dominion of that feeling, over every other in his breast, is sufficiently
indicated by the firmness with which he adhered to this
principle in circumstances the most trying. This feeling naturally
sought for a congenial nature in other breasts, and Williams
soon learned that there were good men in all societies.
He freely joined in worship with all, and imparted his instructions
to all who were disposed to hear him. This liberality,
however, was not inconsistent with theological discussions, in
which he occasionally participated. His dispute with the
Friends gave umbrage to some of that order. It occupied two
or three days, and eventuated by a publication by Williams,
entitled “George Fox digged out of his burroughs.” Although
some of this order seem, for a time, to have remembered this
dispute to his disadvantage, yet there were others who cherished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[p. 218]</span>
for him the kindest and most respectful feelings. Among
these was Governor Jenks, who though a Quaker, bestows the
highest praise on Williams, both as a man and a Christian.</p>

<p>When not engaged abroad on business of the colony, he
statedly preached to the Indians in Narraganset; and those
amongst them, who would hear no one else, were attentive to
him. That branch of the Narragansets, called the Nianticks,
seem to have been an object of his peculiar care. They were so
far Christianized by his labors that they took no part in
Philip’s war, and their present existence, as the only remnant
of a once powerful people, may be traced to the effects of
his ministry.</p>

<p>Williams retained his influence with the Indians nearly to the
last of his and their existence. While Philip was making
preparation for war, in 1671, commissioners were sent to Taunton
to inquire into the cause. Philip, suspicious of their design,
remained in his camp; and when summoned by the commissioners
to meet them, he required that they should meet
him. Matters remained in this posture until Williams, then
seventy years old, with a Mr. Brown offered to become a hostage
in his camp. Philip then met the commissioners, delivered
up seventy guns and promised fidelity. This event gave the
colony four years to prepare for the final struggle.</p>

<p>Whilst, in 1676, this cruel and exterminating war was raging,
the Indians approached the town of Providence. Williams, it
is said, on seeing their advance, still feeling his wonted confidence
in his influence over them, took his staff and left the
garrison. But some of the old warriors on seeing him
approach, advanced from the main body, and told him, that as
for themselves they would do him no harm, nor would any
amongst them who had long known him, but their young men
could not be restrained. Upon which he returned to the garrison.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
